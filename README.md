# Password Generator

 
## Stack
- Javascript
- React Native (modal)
- CSS
- Expo (slider, clipboard)
- Async Storage
- React Navigation (bottom tabs)


## Goal
The objective of the mobile application is to provide a safe and effective tool for generating passwords.

The app allows users to generate random and strong passwords, copy them directly to the clipboard and store them for future access.

This way, users can easily generate, copy and recover passwords whenever necessary.


## Mockups
### HomePage
The homepage of the mobile application presents an intuitive interface where users have a slider at their disposal.

Using this slider, it is possible to select the desired number of characters for the password, ranging from 6 to 20 characters.

This way, users can easily customize the length of the password that the app will generate for them.

### Generate password
On the 'generate password' page, which appears as a modal in the mobile application, users have a black text box available where the generated password is displayed.

To copy the password to the clipboard, simply long press this box.

Additionally, users have the option to save their password by adding it to the list of previously saved passwords.

### Alert
After copying or saving the password, the mobile application displays an alert to the user.

This alert serves to confirm and inform that your action was carried out successfully, ensuring the user that the password was processed as desired.

### My Passwords
On the 'My Passwords' page, users can view all the passwords that they previously decided to save, whenever they pressed the 'Save Password' button.

Furthermore, it offers the functionality to delete a specific password: simply press and hold on the black box corresponding to the desired password.
